The code for ICN broker simulation.

The major objectives that we are looking into are:

1) Reduction in latency

2) Effects of grouping threshold
1) and 2) are shown in same figures under ./simulation/set_broker/plots.$time/    ("C=0.8" means (overall cache capacity)/(overall request range)= 0.8)

#files location
configure files in ./simulation/set_broker/

#Run Simulation:
sh ./simulation/set_broker/run.sh

#more detail
please read ./simulation/set_broker/README.md
